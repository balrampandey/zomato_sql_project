## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 12+
- SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or similar)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balrampandey/zomato_sql_project.git

zomato_sql_project
```

2. **Import the dataset**
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
USE zomato_db;

-- Import CSV files (adjust path as needed)
LOAD DATA INFILE 'restaurants.csv' INTO TABLE restaurants;
LOAD DATA INFILE 'customers.csv' INTO TABLE customers;
LOAD DATA INFILE 'riders.csv' INTO TABLE riders;
LOAD DATA INFILE 'orders.csv' INTO TABLE orders;
LOAD DATA INFILE 'deliveries.csv' INTO TABLE deliveries;
```

3. **Run sample queries**
```sql
-- Execute queries from advanced_query.sql
source advanced_query.sql;
```

## üìã Sample Query Results

### Top Performing Restaurants by Revenue
```sql
SELECT 
    r.restaurant_name,
    r.city,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) AS city_rank
FROM orders o
JOIN restaurants r ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
GROUP BY r.restaurant_name, r.city
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Customer Segmentation Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_category,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(total_spend) as avg_spend,
    SUM(total_orders) as total_orders
FROM (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_amount) as total_spend,
        COUNT(order_id) as total_orders,
        CASE 
            WHEN SUM(total_amount) > (SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM orders) 
            THEN 'Gold' 
            ELSE 'Silver' 
        END as customer_category
    FROM orders 
    GROUP BY customer_id
) customer_segments
GROUP BY customer_category;
```
